# datum-php

Simple (as in VERY simple) database abstraction layer

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/datum-php` with Composer.

Then create a `Database` instance, to call the constructor you will need an `AdapterInterface` implementation instance; there are two adapters included: `MySQLAdapter` and `SQLiteAdapter`, both of which extend from `PDOAdapter`:

```php
$options = [
	'host' => getenv('TEST_DB_HOST') ?: 'localhost',
	'name' => getenv('TEST_DB_NAME') ?: 'test',
	'user' => getenv('TEST_DB_USER') ?: 'root',
];
$adapter = new MySQLAdapter($options);
$database = new Database($adapter);
```

Or using SQLite:

```php
$options = [
	'file' => 'path/to/database.sqlite'
];
$adapter = new SQLiteAdapter($options);
$database = new Database($adapter);
```

#### Simple queries

To run a simple query use the `query` method:

```php
$database->query("CREATE TABLE test ...");
```

```php
$database->query("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test");
```

For `INSERT` statements you can easily get the auto-increment ID with the `lastInsertId` method:

```php
$database->query("INSERT INTO ...");
$id = $database->lastInsertId();
```

If you need to do more complex stuff, you may pass a `Closure` as the third argument, to manipulate the `PDOStatement` object directly:

```php
$params = [4];
$row = $database->query("SELECT * FROM test WHERE id = ?", $params, function($stmt) {
	return $stmt->fetch();
});
```

#### Selecting data

To retrieve data from the database, use the `select` method:

```php
$rows = $database->select("SELECT * FROM test");
```

If you need to pass parameters, pass an `array` as the second argument:

```php
$params = ['Draft'];
$rows = $database->select("SELECT * FROM test WHERE status = ?", $params);
```

Named parameters are supported too:

```php
$params = ['status' => 'Draft'];
$rows = $database->select("SELECT * FROM test WHERE status = :status", $params);
```

To retrieve just one row, use the `first` method:

```php
$params = ['id' => 2];
$row = $database->first("SELECT * FROM test WHERE id = :id", $params);
```

You can also query single, scalar values with the `scalar` method:

```php
$count = $database->scalar("SELECT count(*) FROM test");
```

Chunking is also possible by means of the `chunk` method:

```php
$params = ['Published'];
$database->chunk(100, "SELECT id, title FROM test WHERE status = ?", $params, function($rows) {
	foreach ($rows as $row) {
		// Do something with the row data
	}
});
```

Just pass the number of rows per chunk, the query, its parameters as an `array` and a `Closure` that will be executed for each chunk, and that receives the `$rows`.

#### Transactions

Automatic transactions are supported, if the query generates an error the transaction will be rolled-back automatically, otherwise it will commit.

To use them, call the `transaction` method:

```php
$database->transaction(function($database) {
	$params = ['Draft', 2];
	$database->query("UPDATE test SET status = ? WHERE id = ?", $params);
});
```

Pass a `Closure`, inside it you will call your queries by using the `$database` argument that it receives.

You can also use manual transactions with the `begin`, `commit` and `rollback` methods:

```php
$params = ['Published', 3];
try {
	$database->begin();
	$database->query("UPDATE test SET status = ? WHERE id = ?", $params);
	$database->commit();
} catch (Exception $e) {
	$database->rollback();
}
```
